"""
💬 NLP — Algorithm 2: Sentiment Analysis
=========================================

Learning Objectives:
  1. Build a rule-based sentiment analyzer (VADER-style lexicon approach)
  2. Train TF-IDF + Logistic Regression for binary and fine-grained sentiment
  3. Use pretrained HuggingFace pipeline for state-of-the-art sentiment
  4. Handle negation ('not good') and intensifiers ('very bad')
  5. Evaluate with ROC curve, precision-recall, and confidence calibration
  6. Understand aspect-based sentiment (positive overall, negative shipping)
  7. Compare all three approaches on the same test examples
